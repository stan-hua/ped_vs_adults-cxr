FUS was applied to the VPL nuclei located in the Thalamus during simultaneous Heat+FUS and FUS only conditions where total acquisition time was 674 and 996 seconds for the two and three-condition data. Alternate Heat and Heat+FUS was presented in the former data set for 16s followed by 30s rest. Stimulus on time for both conditions are Heat: 30 122 214 306 398 490 582sec and Heat+FUS: 76 168 260 352 444 536 628sec. However, 3-conditions data was acquired using a randomized stimulus paradigm where stimulus presentation timings are as follows.
