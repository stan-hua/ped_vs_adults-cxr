## Methods

### Subjects

N = 133 for MRI

Participants were recruited on university campus, through advertisements via press reports, social media, and mailing lists
### Task organization

No tasks during MRI – only structural scan sand resting-state scans
Tasks outside of MRI: Brief online assessment (~ 10 min), in person behavioral testing at the University (~ 2 hours)


### Additional data acquired

See above

### Experimental location

University of Graz, Austria, and Technical University of Graz, Austria

### Missing data

Since this study was realized in multiple parts, not all data is available from all participants

The Hormone Health Study (HHS) at the University of California, Santa Barbara was designed to probe an understudied question relevant to half of the world's population: how does the menstrual cycle impact the human nervous system?
To uncover answers, we applied state-of-the-art neuroimaging and physiological recording techniques to assess how human physiology, behavior, and brain structure and function co-fluctuate with naturally cycling hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG)-axis hormones across 3 estimated cycle phases: menses, ovulation, and mid-luteal
